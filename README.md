# Machine Learning Python Environment

A basic environment for machine learning using docker and python.


## Preparing the environment

First, you need to build our image:

```
$ ./bin/build.sh
```

Now you can run the command to get the container up and running:

```
$ ./bin/start-with-jupyter.sh
```

If everything is ok, now you can access in your brower the jupyter url:

```
http://DOCKER_IP:8888
```
